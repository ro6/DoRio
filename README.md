Dom, Reactive in and out

A set of JavaScript functions for composing reactive dom trees.

Primary goal: Enable composing dom trees (using pure JS) that behave as Meteor reactive data consumers.

Secondary goal: Expose dom state and events as a Meteor reactive data source.

Inspired by HLisp (part of [Hoplon](https://github.com/hoplon/hoplon)) and designed to work transparently with [Meteor's](https://github.com/meteor/meteor) reactivity.
